# Webscraper prototype
## Introduction

Hello this app is a web scraping app that I would like to use to demonstrate how to extract 
Data from a website quickly and with precision.

I have used one of my local towns websites (perfectly legal of course!) As this is a type of website
that is packed with information about tourism. I wanted to see if I could extract meaningful information from it,
such as all correspondence related to a subject matter. 
I am doing this to help save time on looking up accurate information based on content on the website as a whole then get the information outputted in a front end environment.

This project is an MVP and not fancifull, so I would ideally like to get the link title; contact & email addresses if possible. The outcomes would be to build this project into an external API or leave it open source for public data capture.
